# Helloplug

This code follows the [Building a web framework from scratch in Elixir](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/building-a-web-framework-from-scratch-in-elixir) by Robert Lord.

It was a pretty fun exercise and introduction to Elixir.

The [Basic Sqlite.Ecto Tutorial](https://github.com/jazzyb/sqlite_ecto/wiki/Basic-Sqlite.Ecto-Tutorial) by Jazzyb was also useful.
